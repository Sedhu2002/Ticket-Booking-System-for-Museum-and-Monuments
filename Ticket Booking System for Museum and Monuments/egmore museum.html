                <p>The Government Museum also known as Egmore Museum or the Madras Museum is the second oldest museums in India. The Government Museum originated from the museum in Madras which was planned by the Madras Literary Society in 1846. It is also the largest museum in South Asia rich in archaeological and numismatic collection. It has the largest collection of Roman antiquities outside Europe.

                    Many of the buildings situated within the Government Museum are over 100 years old. The Government Museum comprises several galleries under various sections like archaeology, anthropology, geology, botany, numismatics, contemporary art, zoology and children. The public library of the museum, also known as Connemara Public Library, bears a 200 feet tower. Although the public library was inaugurated in 1853, it was opened to public in the year 1862.
                    
                    The present National Art Gallery was earlier Victoria Technical Institute Building that was taken over by the authorities and renamed. The same was opened on November 27, 1951 when the museum celebrated its centenary attended and inaugurated by Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru. A rich collection of bronze, Amaravathi marbles and works of preservation along with flora and fauna can be found in the museum. Thus the Government Museum makes you susceptible to Indian art, history, culture and tradition. This is also the reason that thousands of travellers visit this museum every year.</p>

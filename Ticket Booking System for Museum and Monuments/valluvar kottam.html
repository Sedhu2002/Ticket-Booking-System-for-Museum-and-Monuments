                <p>The Valluvar Kottam, located in Chennai, is one such historical monument which is dedicated to the well-known intellectual poet, philosopher and saint, Thiruvalluvar, who penned his well-known Thirukkural more than 2,000 years ago. All the 133 chapters of the Thirukkural comprise of 1330 verses.

                    It was built by M. Karunanidhi, the then Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu, dating back to 1975 â€“ 1976. It stands on the place of a lake which was then used as a dumping ground for the garbage of the entire city. Later on, however, the land was reformed and was used to build the Valluvar Kottam. The construction of Valluvar Kottam was the finest way to pay homage to this great and renowned personality as well his tremendous collection of magnificent works. This is one of the significant sites located in Chennai and is visited by a large number of visitors, every year, from all over the world. In the cultural life of the Tamils, saint Thiruvalluvar has great significance.</p>
